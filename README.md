School Website Announcement: Important Information for Current 11th Graders Regarding Meningococcal Vaccine:
 
North Carolina law mandates that all children entering the 11th grade are required to have a second meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4), (also called Menveo or MedQuadfi). The Meningococcal B vaccine does not count towards the requirement. Meningococcal vaccine is given to help prevent meningitis. Please bring in proof from your health care provider with the date the vaccine was given. 
For complete details and explanations, please review the website https://immunize.nc.gov/schools/ncruleslaws.htm for NC general statutes 130A-157.
 
Please contact the school nurse at _704-290-1520, option #1_ if there are any questions. Thank you.
